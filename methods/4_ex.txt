Ex.4 What will the following code print to the screen?

def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  return
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")

It won't print anything because the return is invoked before the puts within the 
scream method definition, so calling the method scream without puts will not 
print anything on the acreen.
